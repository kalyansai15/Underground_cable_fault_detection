# Underground_cable_fault_detection

This project focuses on developing an underground cable fault detection system that uses a central hub to monitor the cables.
We proposed a fault localization model for the underground cable lines with Arduino. The purpose of this paper is to determine the distance from the base station's underground cable fault in kilometres. In this project we used simple concept of ohmâ€™s low.
