# Underground_cable_fault_detection

This project “Underground Cable Fault Detection System” falls under the category of Internet of Things (IOT). Underground cables are used for power application where it is impractical, difficult or dangerous to use the overhead lines. They are widely used in densely populated urban areas, in factories and even to supply power from the overhead post to the consumer premises. Underground electric cables can be particularly hazardous because any damage to the cables can cause fatal or severe injury. This project focuses on how these faults can be detected by displaying the message on the LCD.
